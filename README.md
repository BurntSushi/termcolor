ripgrep (rg)
------------
`ripgrep` is a command line search tool that combines the usability of The
Silver Searcher (an `ack` clone) with the raw speed of GNU grep. `ripgrep` has
first class support on Windows, Mac and Linux, with binary downloads available
for [every release](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases).

### Quick example comparing tools

This example searches the entire Linux kernel source tree (after running
`make defconfig && make -j8`) for `[A-Z]+_SUSPEND`, where all matches must be
words. Timings were collected on a system with an Intel i7-6900K 3.2 GHz.

Please remember that a single benchmark is never enough! See my
[blog post on `ripgrep`](http://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/)
for a very detailed comparison with more benchmarks and analysis.

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg -n -w '[A-Z]+_SUSPEND'` | 450 | **0.245s** |
| [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) | `ag -w '[A-Z]+_SUSPEND'` | 450 | 0.753s |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=C git grep -E -n -w '[A-Z]+_SUSPEND'` | 450 | 0.823s |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 git grep -E -n -w '[A-Z]+_SUSPEND'` | 450 | 2.880s |
| [sift](https://github.com/svent/sift) | `sift --git -n -w '[A-Z]+_SUSPEND'` | 450 | 3.656s |
| [The Platinum Searcher](https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher) | `pt -w -e '[A-Z]+_SUSPEND'` | 450 | 12.369s |
| [ack](http://beyondgrep.com/) | `ack -w '[A-Z]+_SUSPEND'` | 1878 | 16.952s |

(Yes, `ack` [has](https://github.com/petdance/ack2/issues/445) a
[bug](https://github.com/petdance/ack2/issues/14).)

### Why should I use `ripgrep`?

* It can replace both The Silver Searcher and GNU grep because it is faster
  than both. (N.B. It is not, strictly speaking, a "drop-in" replacement for
  both, but the feature sets are far more similar than different.)
* Like The Silver Searcher, `ripgrep` defaults to recursive directory search
  and won't search files ignored by your `.gitignore` files. It also ignores
  hidden and binary files by default. `ripgrep` also implements full support
  for `.gitignore`, where as there are many bugs related to that functionality
  in The Silver Searcher.
* `ripgrep` can search specific types of files. For example, `rg -tpy foo`
  limits your search to Python files and `rg -Tjs foo` excludes Javascript
  files from your search. `ripgrep` can be taught about new file types with
  custom matching rules.
* `ripgrep` supports many features found in `grep`, such as showing the context
  of search results, searching multiple patterns, highlighting matches with
  color and full Unicode support. Unlike GNU grep, `ripgrep` stays fast while
  supporting Unicode (which is always on).

In other words, use `ripgrep` if you like speed, sane defaults, fewer bugs and
Unicode.

### Is it really faster than everything else?

Yes. A large number of benchmarks with detailed analysis for each is
[available on my blog](http://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/).

Summarizing, `ripgrep` is fast because:

* It is built on top of
  [Rust's regex engine](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex).
  Rust's regex engine uses finite automata, SIMD and aggressive literal
  optimizations to make searching very fast.
* Rust's regex library maintains performance with full Unicode support by
  building UTF-8 decoding directly into its deterministic finite automaton
  engine.
* It supports searching with either memory maps or by searching incrementally
  with an intermediate buffer. The former is better for single files and the
  latter is better for large directories. `ripgrep` chooses the best searching
  strategy for you automatically.
* Applies your ignore patterns in `.gitignore` files using a
  [`RegexSet`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/regex/regex/struct.RegexSet.html).
  That means a single file path can be matched against multiple glob patterns
  simultaneously.
* Uses a Chase-Lev work-stealing queue for quickly distributing work to
  multiple threads.

### Installation

The binary name for `ripgrep` is `rg`.

[Binaries for `ripgrep` are available for Windows, Mac and
Linux.](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases) Linux binaries are
static executables. Windows binaries are available either as built with MinGW
(GNU) or with Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC). When possible, prefer MSVC over GNU,
but you'll need to have the
[Microsoft VC++ 2015 redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145)
installed.

If you're a **Homebrew** user, then you can install it with a custom formula
(N.B. `ripgrep` isn't actually in Homebrew yet. This just installs the binary
directly):

```
$ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/master/pkg/brew/ripgrep.rb
```

If you're an **Archlinux** user, then you can install `ripgrep` from the
[`ripgrep` AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ripgrep/), e.g.,

```
$ yaourt -S ripgrep
```

If you're a **Rust programmer**, `ripgrep` can be installed with `cargo`:

```
$ cargo install ripgrep
```

`ripgrep` isn't currently in any other package repositories.
[I'd like to change that](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/10).

### Whirlwind tour

The command line usage of `ripgrep` doesn't differ much from other tools that
perform a similar function, so you probably already know how to use `ripgrep`.
The full details can be found in `rg --help`, but let's go on a whirlwind tour.

`ripgrep` detects when its printing to a terminal, and will automatically
colorize your output and show line numbers, just like The Silver Searcher.
Coloring works on Windows too! Colors can be controlled more granularly with
the `--color` flag.

One last thing before we get started: `ripgrep` assumes UTF-8 *everywhere*. It
can still search files that are invalid UTF-8 (like, say, latin-1), but it will
simply not work on UTF-16 encoded files or other more exotic encodings.
[Support for other encodings may
happen.](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1)

To recursively search the current directory, while respecting all `.gitignore`
files, ignore hidden files and directories and skip binary files:

```
$ rg foobar
```

The above command also respects all `.ignore` files, including in parent
directories. `.ignore` files can be used when `.gitignore` files are
insufficient. In all cases, `.ignore` patterns take precedence over
`.gitignore`.

To ignore all ignore files, use `-u`. To additionally search hidden files
and directories, use `-uu`. To additionally search binary files, use `-uuu`.
(In other words, "search everything, dammit!") In particular, `rg -uuu` is
similar to `grep -a -r`.

```
$ rg -uu foobar  # similar to `grep -r`
$ rg -uuu foobar  # similar to `grep -a -r`
```

(Tip: If your ignore files aren't being adhered to like you expect, run your
search with the `--debug` flag.)

Make the search case insensitive with `-i`, invert the search with `-v` or
show the 2 lines before and after every search result with `-C2`.

Force all matches to be surrounded by word boundaries with `-w`.

Search and replace (find first and last names and swap them):

```
$ rg '([A-Z][a-z]+)\s+([A-Z][a-z]+)' --replace '$2, $1'
```

Named groups are supported:

```
$ rg '(?P<first>[A-Z][a-z]+)\s+(?P<last>[A-Z][a-z]+)' --replace '$last, $first'
```

Up the ante with full Unicode support, by matching any uppercase Unicode letter
followed by any sequence of lowercase Unicode letters (good luck doing this
with other search tools!):

```
$ rg '(\p{Lu}\p{Ll}+)\s+(\p{Lu}\p{Ll}+)' --replace '$2, $1'
```

Search only files matching a particular glob:

```
$ rg foo -g 'README.*'
```

<!--*-->

Or exclude files matching a particular glob:

```
$ rg foo -g '!*.min.js'
```

Search only HTML and CSS files:

```
$ rg -thtml -tcss foobar
```

Search everything except for Javascript files:

```
$ rg -Tjs foobar
```

To see a list of types supported, run `rg --type-list`. To add a new type, use
`--type-add`:

```
$ rg --type-add 'foo:*.foo,*.foobar'
```

The type `foo` will now match any file ending with the `.foo` or `.foobar`
extensions.

### Regex syntax

The syntax supported is
[documented as part of Rust's regex library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/regex/regex/index.html#syntax).

### Building

`ripgrep` is written in Rust, so you'll need to grab a
[Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in order to compile it.
`ripgrep` compiles with Rust 1.9 (stable) or newer. Building is easy:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
$ cd ripgrep
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/rg --version
0.1.3
```

If you have a Rust nightly compiler, then you can enable optional SIMD
acceleration like so:

```
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo build --release --features simd-accel
```

### Running tests

`ripgrep` is relatively well tested, including both unit tests and integration
tests. To run the full test suite, use:

```
$ cargo test
```

from the repository root.
